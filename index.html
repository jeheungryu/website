    <p class="animated fadeInUp";text-align:justify>Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the <a href="https://niehaus.princeton.edu" target="_blank"> Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance </a> at Princeton University. I obtained my PhD in Political Science from the University of Rochester in July 2020. Here is my current <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">CV</a>. </p>
    
    <p class="animated fadeInUp">My research explores the international political economy and international institutions. My dissertation examines how the design of international agreements is created, and how the rules influence behaviros of various actors. More broadly, I am interested in the firm-level analysis of trade disputes at the WTO, foreign investment decisions and economic sanctions.</p>

    My dissertation examines the political economy of international trade at various levels, ranging from preferential trade agreeements (PTAs) to the World Trade Organization (WTO). In my three related essays, I explore how domestic political coalitions influence countries' trade defensive mechanisms, and further examine countries' trade liberalization efforts at the multilateral level under the WTO. 
    Besides my dissertation, I am interested in trade disputes, foreign investment decisions and economic sanctions, especially at the firm level.
