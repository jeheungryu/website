## Installing Ed: Robust
The first step to install Ed is to download the source files from GitHub. To do so you must have git installed on your computer. You probably have git already, but if you don't, the easiest way is probably to install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (even though we will be using git and github from the terminal in this tutorial). Mac users may want to ensure they have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and its command line tools installed as well. To check if git is running on your system enter the following line on your terminal (remember to ignore the $):
~~~ bash
$ git --version
~~~
To indent specific lines we take advantage of a feature in kramdown that allows us to indicate classes for a line. This approach still allows the line to be readable while editing. 
~~~ markdown
- {:.indent-3} But O heart! heart! heart!
- {:.indent-4} O the bleeding drops of red,
- {:.indent-5} Where on the deck my Captain lies,
- {:.indent-6} Fallen cold and dead.
~~~

Using an FTP client like [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), or [SSH on your terminal](https://www.siteground.com/tutorials/ssh/), you need to push the contents of the `_site` folder to the folder on your server where you would like your project to exist. Depending on your host provider, you may be able to receive help from the sys admins with this step.  -->

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Course Description**: This introductory course is designed to provide students with the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history, background and analytical tools to understand and analyze contemporary &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;international issues among states.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;involved in the field of international relations including the modern theoretical debates &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as neorealism and neoliberalism, the causes and effects of international conflicts, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and economic development and globalization. In addition, we will explore important 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;topics in the 21st century such as transnational terrorism, international law and human &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rights, global warming, financial crises, and the rise of China. The ultimate goal of this &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;course is to develop critical thinking concerning issues in world politics.
